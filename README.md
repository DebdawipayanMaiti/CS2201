# CS2201
This repository contains my coursework and projects for CS2201, showcasing my progress and understanding of fundamental computer science concepts such as algorithms, data structures, and problem-solving using Python.

## 23MS217_CT1,CT2,CT3:
Solution to our classtest problems.(Solution is not correct always)
## 23MS217_endsem:
Solution to endsem problems of Group-A.
## Set1 to Set8: 
Solutions to weekly problem sets assigned throughout the course.
## SS_tab and SS_bisection: 
Reference implementations sourced from Stavik Sahaâ€™s GitHub, used for learning and comparison.
## Practice1, Practice2, and Practice3: 
Personal practice problems solved independently, both from course materials and external sources, in preparation for exams.
## SpecialProblem: 
My first exploration of probabilistic simulation in Python, integrating concepts of randomness and logic for problem-solving.

This repository reflects my hands-on learning journey in Python programming and computational thinking.
