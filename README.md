# CS2201
This repository contains my coursework and projects for CS2201, showcasing my progress and understanding of fundamental computer science concepts such as algorithms, data structures, and problem-solving using Python.

Set1 to Set8: Solutions to weekly problem sets assigned throughout the course.

SS_tab and SS_bisection: Reference implementations sourced from Stavik Sahaâ€™s GitHub, used for learning and comparison.

Practice1, Practice2, and Practice3: Personal practice problems solved independently, both from course materials and external sources, in preparation for exams.

SpecialProblem: My first exploration of probabilistic simulation in Python, integrating concepts of randomness and logic for problem-solving.

This repository reflects my hands-on learning journey in Python programming and computational thinking.
